# 📊 Income Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes income data based on demographic features such as age. The objective is to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand how factors like age impact income levels. The dataset used for this analysis contains records of 22 individuals, including their names, ages, and annual incomes.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:

- **Name**: The individual's name.
- **Age**: The individual's age.
- **Income ($)**: The individual's annual income in USD.

**Sample Data:**

| Name     | Age | Income ($) |
|----------|-----|------------|
| Rob      | 27  | 70,000     |
| Michael  | 29  | 90,000     |
| Mohan    | 29  | 61,000     |
| Ismail   | 28  | 60,000     |
| Kory     | 42  | 150,000    |
| Gautam   | 39  | 155,000    |
| ...      | ... | ...        |

🛠️ Methodology

Data Preparation: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the data distribution and visualized key patterns using various      plotting techniques.

Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between age and income to identify trends.

Modeling (if applicable): Applied regression techniques to predict income based on demographic factors.

🚀 Getting Started

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/Madhusudan0626/Machine-Learning-Lab
    
    Navigate to the project directory:
    
    cd kmeans
    
    Open '.ipynb' in Jupyter NoteBook or Equivalent

📚 Conclusion

This analysis offers a preliminary exploration into income distribution based on age. Future work could        extend this analysis with a larger, more diverse dataset and additional demographic features to draw more      comprehensive conclusions.

📈 Results

Correlation Findings: Identified a moderate correlation between age and income, indicating that income generally increases with age up to a certain point.
Insights:
    Younger individuals (ages 25-35) show varied income levels.
    Higher income levels tend to plateau or decrease slightly beyond middle age.
