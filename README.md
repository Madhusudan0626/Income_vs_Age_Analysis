# üìä Income Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes income data based on demographic features such as age. The objective is to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand how factors like age impact income levels. The dataset used for this analysis contains records of 22 individuals, including their names, ages, and annual incomes.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:

- **Name**: The individual's name.
- **Age**: The individual's age.
- **Income ($)**: The individual's annual income in USD.

**Sample Data:**

| Name     | Age | Income ($) |
|----------|-----|------------|
| Rob      | 27  | 70,000     |
| Michael  | 29  | 90,000     |
| Mohan    | 29  | 61,000     |
| Ismail   | 28  | 60,000     |
| Kory     | 42  | 150,000    |
| Gautam   | 39  | 155,000    |
| ...      | ... | ...        |

K-means Clustering and Elbow Method

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into k clusters. The key challenge in K-means is determining the optimal number of clusters (k). The Elbow Method is a heuristic used to find this optimal number.

The Elbow Method involves running the K-means algorithm with different values of k and plotting the sum of squared distances (also known as inertia) between data points and their corresponding cluster centers. The "elbow" point on the plot, where the rate of decrease sharply slows down, indicates the optimal number of clusters.

In this project, the Elbow Method was applied to determine the ideal number of clusters for the dataset. The sum of squared distances was calculated for k values ranging from 1 to 10, and the results were plotted.

The plot shows a noticeable "elbow" at k = X (replace X with your actual value), suggesting that this is the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. Adding more clusters beyond this point does not significantly reduce the sum of squared distances, indicating diminishing returns and a well-separated clustering at this k value.

Insights:
    Younger individuals (ages 25-35) show varied income levels.
    Higher income levels tend to plateau or decrease slightly beyond middle age.
